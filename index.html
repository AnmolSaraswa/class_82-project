            Visual code studio is used to do coding without internet and it also has a autocomplete feature means if we
            will write starting letters of one word and the whole line will come automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
            Console screen is an area where we can do coding but it will not be shown on webpage it is like rough work
            where we are doing calculations and we will only write the answer in the question. We can open it by right
            clicking the webpage and click Inspect option at the last and then select console option.
        </p>
